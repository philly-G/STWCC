          “While the issue of internet connectivity gets most of the attention,
          it is this combination of factors and difficult decisions that Garza
          says presents the biggest problem. Whether it's a lack of computers or
          even basic physical resources like textbooks, the challenges force
          students to jump through hoops in order to complete assignments. "I've
          seen a lot of high school students type papers with their thumbs...I
          saw a student sitting in front of me on the Metro here in D.C. who had
          taken pictures of a textbook page on their phone so they could read it
          because they didn't have another way to access [it]," Ishmael said.”

          The DATA Act just passed the House in early March. It will improve how
          we collect data about who does and doesn’t have broadband internet in
          the US.
