        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>
          In early March, the House passed a new version of H.R.4229 Broadband
          Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act. The
          goal of this bill is to improve how data is collected about where
          broadband does and doesn’t exist. Right now, the internet service
          providers self report on broadband coverage, but according to CNET,
          “the FCC last year also called out Verizon, T-Mobile and US Cellular
          in a report for overstating their wireless coverage.” The government
          gives funding to areas without coverage, so it’s important to give
          them accurate information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your action item today is to call your Senator to tell them about your
          access to broadband coverage and tell them to support H.R.4229
          Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA)
          Act.

            student you know if you are not a student). You can also tell them
            your internet service provider and your network speed.
