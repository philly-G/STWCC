        <h2>DONATE! DONATE! DONATE!</h2>
        <p>
          2015 became known as “the first generation in history that [could] end extreme poverty” by the World Bank. This is because individuals, like us who donated, gave such large sources of charitable givings that caused global poverty to be cut in half, and extreme poverty in every region of developing countries to decline.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Let this 2020 year be just as memorable. If the United States is suffering this much from the covid-19 outbreak, think about and imagine how others who lack adequate sanitation are doing in third world countries.

            Step 1: Donate a box of canned and/or boxed food items, water, and medical supplies to any refugee camp and/or international orphanage.

          <li class="action-li">
            Step 3: Call an international adoption agency and inquire about adopting a child (or more). If you are unable to adopt, consider sponsoring a child or more in an international refugee camp and/or orphange.
          </li>
          <li class="action-li">
            Step 4: Spread awareness. Post about it on your social medias and inform your family and friends. Maybe start a petition to have the government show them more support in their foreign relations.
