# Activist Toolkit Project

This is a place for you to start building your personal project in week 2.

## Project Requirements
You will:
- Build a multipage website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Include a top navigation bar.
- Use CSS and background image properties to create a parallax scroll effect on the homepage of your website.
- Use the DOM, functions, event listeners, and JavaScript events to create an action item checklist.
- Use flexbox and media rules to create a responsive website.
- Customize the look and feel of your site through colors, images, and  fonts using CSS. 
- Use comments to describe your code.



## Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Customizing the CSS of your site. 
- Adding accessibility features to your website. 
- Adding a resources page where your audience can get more information. 
- Adding social media buttons so your audience can spread the word. 
- Adding additional media like videos, audio, image galleries, etc. to enhance your message.
- Adding user input so your audience can add their own action items. 


# Starter Code File Overview
Your full activity instructions are in HQ, but here's a little cheat-sheet of the files in this project:

## ← index.html
This is your homepage. It should be the first page that you work on.

## ← about.html
This will be your about page. 

## ← take-action.html
This will hold your action item checklist and action description.

## ← script.js
Later this week, you'll edit this file to create your checklist.

## ← styles.css
The file for your styles! We've already included a lot of them for you, but you should customize it as you want. 

## ← extra.css
This is a file for additional CSS that we will add later in the week. It doesn't link to your HTML and any changes that you make in this file will **NOT** show up.
